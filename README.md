- Update database credentials in the application:
  open calldatabase.py in def connect_db change your MySQL username, password, and database name. For example:
  DB_USER = 'your_username', 
  DB_PASSWORD = 'your_password', 
  DB_HOST = 'localhost', 
  DB_NAME = 'stockease_db'

  Once the database is set up, you can start the application:
"python main.py"

Follow the prompts in the interface to manage your grocery stock.
